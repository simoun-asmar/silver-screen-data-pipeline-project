# üé¨ **Silver Screen Movie Revenue Analysis ‚Äì Project Overview**  

##  **Project Goal**  
The **Silver Screen Movie Revenue Analysis** project is a **data pipeline built with dbt (Data Build Tool)** to analyze the financial performance of **Silver Screen** theater locations in **New Jersey**. The project integrates **movie rental costs, ticket sales, and revenue data** from multiple sources to provide insights into **movie profitability, rental cost efficiency, and theater performance**.

---

##  **Business Problem**  

Silver Screen, a **regional movie theater chain** in New Jersey, has been experiencing **inconsistent profitability across locations**.  
Company executives want to **understand the relationship between movie rental costs and ticket revenue** to optimize their **rental strategy and pricing decisions**.

###  **Key Questions to Answer**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Are certain movies more profitable than others?**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Which locations generate the most revenue?**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Does the rental cost for a movie correlate with its ticket sales revenue?**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **How do ticket sales vary across different months and locations?**  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Are there any data inconsistencies that impact business decisions?**  

Silver Screen management needs a **data-driven strategy** to **maximize revenue, reduce losses, and make informed decisions on future movie acquisitions**.

---

##  **Project Solution ‚Äì Data Pipeline**  

To answer these business questions, a **dbt-based data pipeline** was designed. The pipeline consists of **multiple layers of transformations**, ensuring data is **cleaned, structured, and ready for analysis**.

###  **Data Flow & Transformation Process**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Extract & Load Data**: Movie rental costs and ticket transactions are sourced from **five datasets**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Staging Layer**: Raw data is **cleaned** and **missing values are handled** using dbt **macros**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fact Models**: Monthly ticket revenue is aggregated **per location, per movie**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Intermediate Models**: Revenue and rental costs are **merged** into a unified dataset.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Mart Model**: A **business-ready table** provides monthly **movie performance** across all locations.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Testing & Validation**: Custom SQL tests ensure **data accuracy** before business insights are generated.  
7Ô∏è‚É£ **Reporting in Snowflake**: The transformed data is **stored as tables and views** for analysis.  

üìå The **entire process is automated using dbt**, ensuring **consistent transformations, data integrity, and scalability**.

##  **Dataset Overview**  

The analysis is built using data from **multiple sources**:  

| üìÇ Dataset | üìÑ Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **`MOVIE_CATALOGUE`** | List of movies rented by Silver Screen, including **title, genre, studio, and budget**. |
| **`INVOICES`** | Monthly rental costs for each movie at each theater location. |
| **`NJ_001`** | Detailed **ticket transactions** from theater location **NJ_001**. |
| **`NJ_002`** | Aggregated **daily ticket sales** from location **NJ_002**. |
| **`NJ_003`** | Individual **ticket purchases, including snacks & drinks**, from location **NJ_003**. |

 **Challenge:**  
Since each location **stores data in different formats**, the pipeline ensures **uniformity and consistency** across all datasets.

---

##  **Project Structure**  

The repository is organized into **structured folders**, each representing a different step in the data pipeline.

| üìÇ Folder | üìÑ Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **`macros/`** | Custom dbt macros used for **standardizing date truncation** and **handling missing values**. |
| **`models/`** | Contains all **dbt models**, structured in **staging, facts, intermediate, and final marts**. |
| **`test/`** | SQL test cases ensuring **data quality and integrity**. |
| **`snowflake/`** | Final **transformed tables and views** stored in Snowflake. |

üìå **Each model is documented with explanations and images, making it easy to understand the transformations.**

##  **Key Business Insights & Outcomes**  

This project helps **Silver Screen** answer **critical business questions** and optimize its revenue strategy. Some key insights include:

 **High Rental Costs Don't Always Mean High Revenue**:  
- Some movies with **high rental costs** fail to generate proportional revenue.  
- **Insight**: Silver Screen should **re-evaluate its rental agreements** and focus on **high-return movies**.  

 **Location-Based Revenue Trends**:  
- Some theater locations **consistently perform better** than others.  
- **Insight**: Silver Screen can **allocate more marketing budget** to underperforming locations.  

 **Seasonal Trends in Ticket Sales**:  
- Revenue fluctuates **across different months**, showing **seasonal patterns**.  
- **Insight**: Silver Screen can **adjust pricing** during peak and low-demand periods.  

 **Data-Driven Decision Making**:  
- The **final mart table** enables **data analysts and executives** to make **fact-based** business decisions.
